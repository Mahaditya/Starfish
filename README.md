This Library is a dream come true for someone who has write same logic in more than 10 programming languages.

How to use
You will find a file named main.py in the main directory (Starfish).

This has all the imports already present to write all the language components

Rules- All the code should be wrapped inside a CodeBlock. Once inside a code block you can write a function or loop etc and other algorithms (e.g read).

**** How to write your own Algorithms Classes **** 
Just extend the Algorithm class in your custom class and implement the abstract funtions.
